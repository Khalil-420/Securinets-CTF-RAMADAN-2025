        Poetry is a lovely thing,
	back in the early days 
	peoples used to share data
	through poems is it the case?

	Silent Trails Echo Gentle Air,
	Nightâ€™s Owls In Moonlight Sing.
	Over Waves, Serenity Awaits,
	In Dreams, A Mind Ascends.
	Zephyr Invites New Growth.
	Amidst Zealous Inspirations,
	Never-ending Gratitude.
