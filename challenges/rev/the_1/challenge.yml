  A cryptographer designed a secure encryption system, protected by a complex cryptographic mathematical structure. The challenge revolves around a black-box executable that accepts a key.

  He was paranoid about security, embedding some measures to stop reversers if tampered with. Debuggers crash instantly. Static analysis reveals nothing but noise. Traditional cryptanalysis methods lead to dead ends.

  This is not a simple cipherâ€”it requires a good mathematical mind and some arithmetic skills to break. Hidden within its code, there is a way for skilled players to exploit it.

  Can you find it and recover the key?
