Hi, my name is James Harper,I'm based in a city in the US, but at work, they call me "Glitch." I'm still young—I was born in 1999. I work for the FBI, but I have a bad memory, so most of my account passwords are just my birthday.

November 20, 2024, was the worst day of my life. It was the day my little girl died. I can still remember the days leading up to it so vividly. Just four days before, we were celebrating my birthday together. She was so full of life, her laughter filled the room, and her smile was like sunshine. She was my angel, my everything.

Then came that dreadful day. November 20 started like any other. I was at home, and she had gone to school as usual. Around 11 a.m., I got a call. It was Detective Laura Kline, a friend and colleague. Her voice was trembling, and I could hear her crying. I didn’t understand what was happening. All she said was, "James, drop everything and come immediately. There’s been a murder."

At first, I thought it was just another case. But when I arrived, the world around me collapsed. It was her—my little girl. My heart shattered into a million pieces. I I couldn’t breath, couldn’t think. The sight of her, lifeless, broke something deep inside me.

The investigation dragged on for weeks, but I wasn’t allowed to be part of it. They told me it was a conflict of interest because it involved my family. Eventually, they forced me out of my job. They said it was protocol, but I couldn’t shake the feeling there was something more to it. They wouldn’t share any progress, and everything about the case felt... off.

I couldn’t sit back and do nothing. Quietly, I decided to investigate on my own. The only person I trusted with this was Detective Laura Kline. I needed her help, and I knew she would always have my back.

The first thing I did was check my daughter’s phone. I unlocked it easily—I knew her better than anyone. I found her camera and managed to retrieve fingerprints from it using some basic tools. It wasn’t much, but I could tell something wasn’t right.

The questions kept piling up in my head, haunting me every night:

●Why did they kick me out of the investigation?
●Why wouldn’t they share any progress with me?
●Why did my daughter leave school that day?
●Why was Rose Harrie, her classmate, so nervous and hesitant to answer my questions?
●Where was her boyfriend, David Moore? No one seemed to know.
●Why did Captain William Hayes dodge my calls, only saying, "We’ll tell you when we find something"?
Nothing made sense, and the more I thought about it, the more determined I became. I needed answers. I needed to know the truth.
